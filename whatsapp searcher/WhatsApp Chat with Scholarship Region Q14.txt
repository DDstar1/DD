5/19/21, 6:31 PM - +234 913 881 8912: *🔊 AD - MALE RIGHT*

Much more girls than boys are given birth to, much more male babies and foetuses than female ones are lost, men die much earlier than do women, men commit suicide more often than do women, male homosexuality is condemned while female homosexuality is not only condoned but also visibly encouraged, men are subject to a lot of more health disabilities than are women (yet the health sector of most countries takes the health of women more seriously than it does the health of men), the male chromosome is in danger of extinction - and all these is just the tip of the ice-berg. Yet all the world  
seems to think of is women, and how to fight for their rights and for their empowerment. Men have conquered for so long that they have gotten laid back, and women today seem to be more manly than men.

It is as a consequence of the threats posed by anomalies like unto those stated above that Male Rights came into being. Do join us in financing the activities of Male Rights by donating through the following bank accounts.........

My name is *James Temitope Jane* popularly known as Coach Jane, I am a Registered Health Information Manager and a Super Affiliate Marketer. 😁

I graduated with distinction and was earning 40k monthly until last year when I came across Affiliate Marketing; at first I thought it was a scam😬 and decided to do some research then I found out it was the same business model that made Jeff Bezos (AMAZON) rich...

 ```I said to myself Ehn ehn so no be scam? 🤯``` 

It is a legitimate source of income and has been making young people all over the world rich even in India.. 💯

Affiliate marketing is an online business model which involves you recommending helpful products to people who need them and can afford them; simply put “connecting buyers to sellers”.... It is a proven model that works all over the world and has been in existence since 1989.🙂

 *It is not MLM (Multilevel marketing)❌* 
 *It is not Network Marketing ❌* 
 *It is not Ponzi Scheme ❌* 
 *It is not a get rich quick scheme❌* 

 _Over 2850 successfully trained 😎_ 

Join the league of young Nigerians earning legitimate income and making it in this business...

8/24/21, 6:28 PM - +234 813 619 5050: *🔊 AD*

In this digital age (especially the post covid-19 pandemic period), the easiest and highly demanded digital skill you can learn that can relieve you of financial stress is *AFFLIATE MARKETING.* 

How powerful it is to recommend a product that is not yours to someone who really needs it and you get paid for it. 

 ```So easy 
See something!!!``` 

While Jumia’s affliate commission list for their products are 8%, 5%, 2% and so on, Expertnaire’s list of commission for products you recommend to someone is 30%, 40%, 50% and even 80%.
Let’s do the math!!!

As an affiliate, I sell a ₦45,000 product and its commission is 50% which is ₦22,500. 
If I sell it to 10 different persons who really want it and can afford it, that’s ₦225,000 straight to my pocket in a week 
*(Cus Expertnaire pays affiliates every Friday for whatever product you sell.)* 
Just imagine you are making this weekly at least. 
Would you still be broke?? Nope!

And then 900k monthly (225k x 4 weeks)
 That’s huge!!

This is an aspect that we all struggle with in parenting, our children's sexuality, sexual urge, sex education, immorality, virginity and purity.

On a daily basis I hear and feel parents anxiety, lack of confidence, confusion on when do I start, what do I say, how do I say it, where do I say it, and the questions are understandable but knowing what to do and doing it keeps your heart at peace. 

The number one thing on this journey of our children's sexuality, that, YOU MUST BE COMFORTABLE ABOUT YOUR OWN SEXUALITY. 

 ```You Must Be Able To Discuss Your Own Sexuality Without Inhibition.``` 

YOU CAN'T GIVE WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE. 
BE OPEN TO LEARNING

9/27/21, 6:25 PM - +234 813 619 5050: *🔊 AD - NEOLIFE BUSINESS*

• Do you have issues becoming financially independent?

• Do you think you aren't paid enough to meet up with your daily needs, let alone fulfilling that big dream of yours?

• Are you unhappy with your current state of financial incompetence?

🥳 ```Worry no more as Neolife's got you covered.``` 

This is a business sector where professionals share business opportunities to people who are hungry for financial freedom. You can be the Joseph that has been placed in your family to elevate others and you don't even know. Opportunities don't always come as we'd expect, rather, they come in a disguise manner.

I have always belonged to this school of thought that says "Education is the key" but has it really been? 
If yes, then why are alot of graduates still in the street seeking for jobs day and night? Education being regarded as the key, later gave way to learning a skill as the best way to get money. Is this really true? I remember working under someone and what I was earning at the end of the month, consumed only my transportation fee, feeding expenses wasn't included. What then was I working for? I asked myself.. 
Few months ago, I came across a friend who introduced me to the business. At first I felt reluctant to join, so my friend persuaded me to just attend a seminar which I attended. On getting there, I saw different personalities coming to say a thing about this company but the most important thing that caught my attention was the amount of money these persons where receiving at the end of the month, even with eyes closed. I then decided to ask questions as to what they did, how they did it and what I needed to do to become like them and today, I'm one of the associate.
I feel excited to share this opportunity to as many people as possible especially young people who are struggling to make the best out of themselves in life.

*HOW I MOVED FROM MAKING ZERO NAIRA ONLINE TO MAKING AT LEAST 100K WEEKLY*

I was once like you who thought all online businesses are scam 😔 

I did not want to hear anything about making money online because I thought there is no legit means of making money online 😬

But my friend proved me wrong when she introduced me to a business model called *AFFILIATE MARKETING*

And in this training, I will be introducing that same business to you

And that has been the best decision I made this year and it can also be the best decision you will make

 *This training is for you;* 
✅ If earning at least 50k-100k weekly sounds too good to be true
✅ If you are a stay at home mum 
✅ If you are a student and you want extra income 
✅ If you are 9-5 and you want a side hustle 

```Then This Training is For You``` 

*But please ignore this post:* 
🚫 If you are looking for a get rich scheme
🚫 If you are lazy and you are not ready to work
🚫 If you have a negative mindset about making money online
🚫If you can't dedicate your time

 _Affiliate Marketing is not for the lazy ones and I don't want someone to stress me_ 

I will be organizing a *FREE Training* on how you can get started with affiliate marketing

*PS:* There is no way 300 people can be wrong about this

Finally! 
The fastest way to make up to ₦400k a month with zero capital using Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp (affiliate marketing) 

I found out the easiest and fastest way for a beginner to start making money online.

Even if you’re just starting out today, this business model can help you make ₦300,000 to ₦500,000 within your first month (even if you’re a slow learner with no prior experience).

 ```All you need to do is promote a very hot selling product that is already making sales.``` 

Imagine you sell 10 units of a hot product that pays you ₦25,000 in commission, that is ₦250,000 cash into your bank account.

*Hi, my name is Ayomide Olatunde*
I am a law student of the University of Ibadan.

Earlier this year, I was seriously in need of a business that could generate me an income aleven as a student, hearing about the devastating unemployment rate in Nigeria.


 *Why was this?* 
One day a question struck my mind and here was the question,
 _"what if after studying this course, I join the thousands of unemployed undergraduates getting frustrated looking for jobs, how would I survive?"_

This question made me realise that I have to prepare for the unforseen at every moment in my life so as not to be caught unaware. 

I had watched my mum labour soo hard as an employee and I know the heartaches she went through reporting at work early in the morning and back home as late as 9pm.
 Yet, the job didn't even give her great income to make anything for herself.
 

 All she could do was settle debts, help some family members in the village, give us something to eat, send us to school and that was all. 
She couldn't even spend her hard earned money on herself! 

I knew if I didn't do something while I was still younger, I would most likely end up in that cycle.

This same question led me to surfing the Internet for a flexible business I could run alongside my law degree. 


The search went on for almost 2 weeks until I stumbled on a *1 day training that introduced a legitimate business that I could run online.* 

I immediately went through the video training to see what was there after which I was convinced that it was a business I could run alongside my law degree as there were notable people from diverse profession such as lawyers, doctors, nurses, professors, students and even the unemployed, this business could even pay much more than most salary jobs in Nigeria. 


6 months later, that business I was introduced to in that 1 day training has made me over 1 million naira. 

Well you might think I'm bluffing, but how about I show you whether I am or not in my one day intensive training. 

This November alone, I have done over 300k and the month is not over yet, meaning there is still much money to be made.

 *Here is why I am telling you this.* 
I know some people have dreams but they are limited because of funds to chase their dreams and desires, thousands of graduates are unemployed and even those in a 9-5 are living in debt due to low salary and the height of inflation is alarming. 

 So I have decided to train as many Nigerians that desire financial breakthrough.


You might want to lie to yourself that this isn't for you but if you earn 300k and below monthly, then this is for you.

*"They Banned Crypto, Forex & Twitter. Then They Froze Accounts of Bamboo, Chaka & Risevest…"*

DO YOU STILL THINK YOUR GOVERNMENT CARES ABOUT YOU?

Dear Friend,

A war is at our doorstep.

And I don’t say that to scare you at all.

But if you take a good look around you.

You’d see what I mean.

Our not so beloved country is in the muuuuuud.

Doctors were on strike for months and the government didn't give a flinch about it.

*The economy is spiraling backwards and all they care about is borrowing billions just to stuff up their pockets.*

I mean look at it…

Every day, new rules are created to sabotage our future…

And make us dependent on a system that’s already broken.

First, it was Gokada, then Opay…

Then they froze bank accounts of peaceful protesters who were fighting against the corrupt system.

As if that wasn’t enough.

They ate Crypto up for lunch and decided Twitter was for dinner.

And, truth is, they’re still hungry.

As long as they have no control and there is a slight chance it’ll thrive beyond measurable doubt…

*They take it away!*

*Now, do you still think your government cares about you?*

2022 is just a few days away.

No matter how you look forward to it, if you don't put in the right energy to make things work, nothing will be "NEW" about the New Year.

*If you would like to increase your income and make up to N150k weekly in 2022?*

Then I want to show you just how to do that with affiliate marketing in just as little as 2-3 months...

The same way many young Nigerians I'd be showing you testimonials of have been doing.

*What's more...*

- You'd get access to over 1000 done-for-you marketing campaigns and templates you can copy to start printing money in as little as 72 hours.

- You'd also have access to my 3x formula calculator that literally helps you predict your weekly affiliate earnings from every campaign.

- You'd get a free video walkthrough of a secret method the government doesn't want you to know about that you can use to make N150k monthly and cover your ads costs.

- Irresistible offer training that'd make prospects drool over every offer you make them.

- Access to expertnaire's marketplace with over 60 products you can start selling to make money asap.

- A comprehensive training on how to use WhatsApp to sell to anyone

- Access to over 50 WhatsApp TV you can run ads on and get massive exposure.

- and so much more

The truth is, you'd literally be getting everything you need to succeed and start making up to N150k in a very short time.

So no excuses anymore.

It's up to you to decide if you'd want to continue treading the path you're on now or if you'd like to change course and increase your earnings rapidly come 2022.

Anyway, if you find this intriguing and would like to change the narrative of your financial life, then I'd be more than happy to show you just how to go about it.

*Simply click here to get started now* - https://tiny.one/earn250k

To a better 2022.

1/10/22, 6:43 PM - +234 818 216 9911: *🔊 AD*

*All she could do was settle debts..*

I had watched my mum labour soo hard as an employee and I know the heartaches she went through reporting at work early in the morning and back home as late as 9pm.

Yet, the job didn't even give her great income to make anything for herself.
 

 All she could do was settle debts, help some family members in the village, give us something to eat, send us to school and that was all. 
She couldn't even spend her hard earned money on herself! 

I knew if I didn't do something while I was still younger, I would most likely end up in that cycle.

This led me to surfing the Internet for a flexible business I could run alongside my law degree. 


The search went on for almost 4 weeks until I stumbled on a *1 day training that introduced a legitimate business that I could run online.* 

I immediately went through the video training to see what was there after which I was convinced that it was a business I could run alongside my law degree as there were notable people from diverse profession such as lawyers, doctors, nurses, professors, students and even the unemployed, this business could even pay much more than most salary jobs in Nigeria. 


6 months later, that business I was introduced to in that 1 day training has made me over 3 million naira. 

Well you might think I'm bluffing, but how about I show you whether I am or not in my one day intensive training. 

December 2021 alone, I made over 800k from this same business model I'll show you. 

 *Here is why I am telling you this.* 
I know some people have dreams but they are limited because of funds to chase their dreams and desires, thousands of graduates are unemployed and even those in a 9-5 are living in debt due to low salary and the height of inflation is alarming. 

 So I have decided to train as many Nigerians that desire financial breakthrough.


You might want to lie to yourself that this isn't for you but if you earn 300k and below monthly, then this is for you. 


 ```Affiliate Marketing has changed my life and I decided to change people's life like the way my friend did.```

*HOW TO STUDY ABROAD FOR FREE!*

https://www.studygatecanada.com/homepage

Hi,
My name is *Ikenna*, and I am from Imo state

In May 2021, I got admitted to the University of British Columbia, Canada, which is a top school worldwide.
My masters is funded by the university, and here I am studying with alot of other students whose programs are also fully funded.

Since I got to Canada, I have gotten lots of questions on how to study abroad for free from my friends and everybody I know. So I decided to put together a comprehensive course that would take anyone step by step from knowing nothing about admission and scholarships to knowing everything you need to study abroad for free at your dream University.

*DISCOVER THE 7 STEPS TO A NO FAIL INCOME SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP YOU GENERATE AT LEAST 150K/WEEK PRESSING YOUR PHONE* 

I am just like you few years ago who have been  looking for legit ways to make money online. 
I met my friends for advise, she introduced me to a ponzi scheme, I invested my little savings, guess what!!🤔 It failed 😔. As you all know am much into all these online business...as the last one I did n promise not to do again is racksterli.... If you're my actiive friend on Facebook and WhatsApp you would know, same thing happened to me again and again.

I discovered that there are a lot of opportunities to make money online,i can't utilize the opportunity because I have not acquired the skills needed to utilize the opportunities. I remembered how I told a friend about my desire to get an online job, he offered me a job but I could not deliver because he needed a marketer and I don't know anything about  marketing,this was how I lost a monthly salary of 225k😭

*I discovered that all I needed now is to acquire a skill and definitely, the money would come. ☺* 

This time, I was ready to pay any amount to learn a new skill because  I really needed to change my financial status. 

Guess what? 😊❤
One day, I stumbled on a genuine and much easier way of making  extra money online, I am sure it is not a pyramid  scheme or the mmm type. It is a self developing course online and it's been amazing. At first, I found it difficult to get the course because  of my financial state, I borrowed from a friend,i promised to pay her in 2 months time,guess what? 😊 
I paid her half the money in one week after practicing the little I learnt from the course, ohh yes!! 
 It's been amazing💃🏼

I am yet to finish the course and I am already making thousands of naira,i know I will make more because my friends are making up-to 250k to 300k in a week... 

 ```Friends, Do you care to get the same video that transformed my life?``` 

 If yes,

*If I told you that you can become a millionaire in 2022, would you take the step to?* 

My name is Favour Amubode and, as the beginning of 2021, I was *JUST* another law student of the University of Ibadan. 

I had more bills to pay than I could possibly afford, debts piling up and needs I couldn't meet. 

In my quest to get out of my financial turmoil, I came across affiliate marketing and that was it! 

*Now, I am so much more*

I can go on and on on how much my life has changed exponentially in not just my finances (banking 6 figures every week) 🤑 but as a person as well 😌


But, you know what?
I'd rather show you directly in my two-days intensive training.

In January alone I have made over 200k and the month is far from over!


You might want to lie to yourself that this isn't for you, but if you earn 300k and below monthly, then this is for you. 

```Affiliate Marketing has changed my life and I have chosen to play a role in changing the lives of others too.``` 

*THE FREE AFFILIATE BOOTCAMP™ BATCH 8 HAS LAUNCHED*

_“The Ultimate Affiliate Marketing Training Program Designed To Take You From Beginner to 6 Figure Super Affiliate in Record Time!”_

So if you’re ready to learn the secrets to my success, take action and join my  FREE Affiliate Bootcamp! 

*Make today is the first day of the rest of your life.* 

🚫 BUT PLEASE don't click on this if you have some kind of negative money mindset about Making Money Online because I've been there.

 ```HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY LEVERAGING ON THE INTERNET?!``` 

🤔 Thinking about how things are extremely difficult and expensive in the country makes me feel very sad, yet salaries are not increasing. 

Food prices are on the high side. Inflation everywhere and further devaluation of naira and it is the poor masses that suffer it. 

So it becomes important that since the government does not care for its citizens, then the citizens should care for themselves by seeking more ways to generate income so they can live above the poverty level and also live the life of their dreams.

The difference between a *RICH MAN & POOR MAN is the ACCESS TO QUALITY INFORMATION* and I'm here to bridge that gap.

*That is why I decided to reveal to you what young people like me do to make 300k-400k monthly with just a smartphone while leveraging on selling other people's products.*

I am hosting a *FREE* WhatsApp Class that would guide you through the process.

Chidinma is a graduate of a reputable Nigerian University. She studied hard and came out with a 2nd class upper(4.1/5.0)

She comes from a middle income background, no rich uncles or aunties, no big person up there to help find a good job and she's the only hope for her parents & siblings.

The pressure is overwhelming for her. Am sure you can relate with this?

She hopes to get a good paying job but she's been trying for 4 years now and counting.

*She wants more out of life, she wish she can give her parents a little taste of the good life before they die. SHE WANTS MORE!*

Aren't we all an 'Innocent" Oliver twist like Chidinma? Don't we all have dreams that have been thwarted by our environment? Don't we all want more?

How do we tell Chidinma that the country is not getting any better and that her chances of getting a good job is very slim?

How do we tell her that her certificate is close to useless in Nigeria and there's nothing she can do about it especially in this our country?

Is she not aware not some Masters & PhD holders are jobless, even found in construction sites as labourers.

Aren't most of us like Chidinma?
Don't we all want more and we are confused where to start from?

Shockingly, there is good news, if only you are willing to believe it. I found a way I have been using for more than 3 years now.

It's an unusual secret which will help you never go broke if you are willing to learn and implement these strategies. I'm willing to share it with a selected few who are serious about learning what the rich know.

I'm going to show you how to secure a consistent flow of income and not just that, but how to never lose it to scams and Ponzi.

Are you tired?
Do you want to do better?
DO YOU WANT MORE?

I'm willing to show you how, join in let me show you a new life.

Don't take my word for it, but see for yourself.

*HURRY NOW BEFORE THE GROUP GETS FILLED:*
 http://drkellyola.com/nevergobroke5/

 
*I am not selling you anything. This is just my own way of giving back and helping people who feel lost, depressed & angry about their situation & helping them achieve their dreams just like I did.*

I am a Medical Doctor in Akwa-Ibom state, Nigeria, I don't even depend on my salary at all, because the government always pays late, months later & because I earn 3x & sometimes 4x my salary monthly as a Medical Doctor in Nigeria through these secrets I am teach you.

❗❗ *JUST BECAUSE YOU EARN 30K MONTHLY, DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE MORE*


*HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY LEVERAGING ON THE INTERNET?!*

Thinking about how things are extremely difficult and expensive in the country makes me feel very sad, yet salaries are not increasing. 

Food prices are on the high side. Inflation everywhere and further devaluation of naira and it is the poor masses that suffer it. 

So it becomes important that since the government does not care for its citizens, then the citizens should care for themselves by seeking more ways to generate income so they can live above the poverty level and also live the life of their dreams.

The difference between a *RICH MAN & POOR MAN is the ACCESS TO QUALITY INFORMATION* and I'm here to bridge that gap.

*That is why I decided to reveal to you what young people like me do to make 300k-400k monthly with just a smartphone while leveraging on selling other people's products.*

I am hosting a *FREE* WhatsApp Class that would guide you through the process.

My name is Favour Amubode and I am one of those whose life has completely changed because of Affiliate Marketing

As a result of this, I sought to introduce as many persons as possible to this life changing opportunity.

However, despite the numerous persons that want to get started as affiliates on the big platforms of Expertnaire or Learnoflix, most didn't have the start-up fee

I do agree that 50k, 60k is not exactly easy to come by

And for so long, I have been looking for a way to help people achieve their affiliate dream

So, what did I do?

*❌Before I go on,* 
*If you're expecting a freebie or an handout,* *this definitely isn't for you!*

So please, stop reading now so as not to waste your time or mine

But if you are ready to commit a small percentage of your resources,
Then, by all means, this is for you

*I found the ultimate system that enables you to sell on the big affiliate platforms (yes, I'm talking Expertnaire and it's likes) and still earn sweet commissions*🤌🏾

You won't have to pay 60k, 50k not even 30k! 

I still feel we are crazy for doing this!

Get this:

2/27/22, 6:40 PM - +234 818 216 9911: *HOW I WENT FROM A DEAD-BROKE BOOK SMART MEDICAL STUDENT TO EARNING MILLIONS*

You might be wondering,as a medical student I should fully focus on my books 😅 and not business. 

You’re right,I pay due diligence to my books and besides I even finished my pre medical level with a *4.89 CGPA* (That was just by the way)

Back in 2020 during the pandemic 

I remember having just 13,000 naira in my account as at then and out of looking for ways to make more money I signed up for a *Ponzi* scheme .

After bringing 2 people that brought 2 people that brought another 2 people🤡.

Guess what happened next?

I eventually *lost it all* after having high hopes of cashing out big. I’m sure you might have experienced the pain that comes with losing money to ponzis.

 I went totally broke with no money to even buy data.Had to rely on night sub of #25 to come online.Omoo, tough times😂

Fast forward now I’ve been able to generate over *$20,000* in sales for my 2 businesses. 

What changed? 

I’ll tell you now, In my 2 years of doing several businesses both online and physical from selling books,supplements,crypto and lot more🤗

I can only say one thing, selling other people's products for a part of their profit has always been a huge and profitable business.

Million dollar  businesses like JUMIA, AMAZON, KONGA and many more use this same model.

Just look at those Dangote cement main distributors. They didn't have to build a cement factory to start a business.They just sell and add prices.

This business  has earned me the first *7 figures* of my life.Just imagine being a student earning that much even before graduating .

Well I’ve created *Free webinar* where I will be showing you how you can also make money from this business model

Click on the link below👇🏽 to get access.

https://wa.link/832382

Also I'll be giving a few people some opportunities to change their lives at the end of the class too

P.S; this webinar is for people who dare and want to make a difference, those who are ready to change their story in 2022, just like me. I have given my time to make this worth your time.

They drive some kilometers and return again.

Small small like that many times can give the petrol station N5000 in a day from one driver.

Many small small times add to hundreds of thousands daily.

*If I told you that you could be a millionaire in 2022, would you take the step to?* 

My name is Favour Amubode and, as of March 2021, I was *JUST* another law student of the University of Ibadan. 

I had more bills to pay than I could possibly afford, debts piling up and needs I couldn't meet. 

In my quest to get out of my financial turmoil, I came across affiliate marketing and that was it! 

*Now, I am so much more*

I can go on and on on how much my life has changed exponentially in not just my finances (banking 6 figures every week) 🤑 but as a person as well 😌


But, you know what?
I'd rather show you myself. 

From February alone I have made over 3
350k and the year is far from over!


You might want to lie to yourself that this isn't for you, but if you earn 300k and below monthly, then this is for you. 

```Affiliate Marketing has changed my life and I have chosen to play a role in changing the lives of others too.``` 


So if you’re ready to learn the secrets to my success, take action and find out if you're qualified now.

❗❗ *JUST BECAUSE YOU EARN 30K MONTHLY, DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE MORE*


*HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY LEVERAGING ON THE INTERNET?!*

Thinking about how things are extremely difficult and expensive in the country makes me feel very sad, yet salaries are not increasing. 

Food prices are on the high side. Inflation everywhere and further devaluation of naira and it is the poor masses that suffer it. 

So it becomes important that since the government does not care for its citizens, then the citizens should care for themselves by seeking more ways to generate income so they can live above the poverty level and also live the life of their dreams.

The difference between a *RICH MAN & POOR MAN is the ACCESS TO QUALITY INFORMATION* and I'm here to bridge that gap.

*That is why I decided to reveal to you what young people like me do to make 300k-400k monthly with just a smartphone while leveraging on selling other people's products.*

I am hosting a *FREE* WhatsApp Class that would guide you through the process.

❗❗ *JUST BECAUSE YOU EARN 30K MONTHLY, DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE MORE*


*HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY LEVERAGING ON THE INTERNET?!*

Thinking about how things are extremely difficult and expensive in the country makes me feel very sad, yet salaries are not increasing. 

Food prices are on the high side. Inflation everywhere and further devaluation of naira and it is the poor masses that suffer it. 

So it becomes important that since the government does not care for its citizens, then the citizens should care for themselves by seeking more ways to generate income so they can live above the poverty level and also live the life of their dreams.

The difference between a *RICH MAN & POOR MAN is the ACCESS TO QUALITY INFORMATION* and I'm here to bridge that gap.

*That is why I decided to reveal to you what young people like me do to make 300k-400k monthly with just a smartphone while leveraging on selling other people's products.*

I am hosting a *FREE* WhatsApp Class that would guide you through the process.

*THE STUDY IN CANADA MASTERCLASS TRAINING* 🔥
How *Micheal Apata* , who was an ordinary graduate of oye-ekiti university became a Msc, Phd and a current seasonal lecturer at University of Manitoba, Canada.👇👇👇

He was an ordinary Nigerian student who also suffered through the schooling system of the country.
*Until, one day, he discovered a great secret which later made him an international student in Canada.😱*
Through this great discovery, he was able to buy his first house while still a student and was even able to get his citizenship and permanent residence just two years after getting to Canada! 😲

*Micheal Apata has packaged this great discovery of his into a Premium MASTERCLASS Training.* 🔥 
This MASTERCLASS Training contains series of video that shows the step-by-step process of how you can apply to Canada, study and convert your study status to your permanent residence and eventually your citizenship.

 ```This is not a Gimmick! This is what Micheal Apata himself did!``` 

You would not just learn the no fail way to be a student in Canada, but, also, how to succeed in Canada.

*You can overcome the no-good, backwards driven situation of the Nigerian economy, change your circumstance and story to that of success and watch as your life transforms to greatness, and your dreams finally come true.*

*In the MASTERCLASS Training Program, you will learn:*
• Everything you need to know when and before choosing a school in Canada e.g : The school's Province and Location.
• How to get your first job to sustain yourself in Canada.
• How to increase your odds with visa approval and avoid visa refusal and student permit denial.

Things are not going to get better.
I know this sounds harsh but that's the truth.

You might have to carry on living from pay to pay while working 11 hours a dayjust to earn enough to survive each day
And this is not your fault.It's not because you're not smart enough or because you're not determined enough.
It's just how the system has been designed to operate:
Only the few are favoured while the rest are left to suffer.
But you don't have to live that way (not anymore)

You don't have to
• sell your soul to your job
• kneel and crawl before your rich relative or friend
• or spend outrageous fees just to get an extra degree.
🩸What you need is a method that gives you the earning power
you needso that you can
• afford whatever you want
• take care of your loved ones
• and travel wherever you want without feeling scared thatyou're going to go broke

And I show you this method in my *EARN IN DOLLARS WEBINAR*
The sign up fee for the webinar is just #2000 only…

And slots are filling up real fast
The registration link will shut down as soon as I get the exact
number of people who I can host at once during a live
session…
You can choose to squander that 2K you have or use it for something worthwhile like improving yourself financially.

So here's your link to get in now:

"The ASUU strike in 2018 changed my life," said Tamilore

I finally met my billionaire mentor Akin Alabi and that conference was the turning point to  making my first 7 figures legally Online 

One of my goals in 2022 is to help at least 100 people make their first 1 million online

In 2021, a total of 33 of my students made their first 1 million online which was exciting to me. Hence I want to do more especially because of the financial downturn people are experiencing in the country 

I'd be hosting a FREE webinar revealing the exact same steps my students and I took.

The dollar to naira rate is now ₦600 to $1.

I know, you find it alarming too right? 

But let me show you the bright side: 

*It means that it is now 599 times easier to make a million naira*

1 million naira is just $2000

So, if you have a way to  earn passively in dollars, you won't ever be bothered about the constant fall of naira 

This is exactly why publishing books on Amazon is one of the best things to happen to the Internet and to you 

And with the blueprint I found, you get to be paid in dollars every single month!

https://wa.link/uwchnc


And get this:

✔️ You don't even need to know how to write 

✔️ You don't need any  prior experience 

✔️You don't need to pay a dime for adverts

✔️It won't consume your time  

✔️It is easy for you to learn and implement. 


I have made a FREE video training on how you too can start and scale up to earning thousands of dollars publishing books on Amazon. 

So, click the link now to learn more and get access to my training while it is still FREE!

The dollar to naira rate is now ₦600 to $1.

I know, you find it alarming too right? 

But let me show you the bright side: 

*It means that it is now 599 times easier to make a million naira*

1 million naira is just $2000

So, if you have a way to  earn passively in dollars, you won't ever be bothered about the constant fall of naira 

This is exactly why publishing books on Amazon is one of the best things to happen to the Internet and to you 

And with the blueprint I found, you get to be paid in dollars every single month!

✔️It won't consume your time  

✔️It is easy for you to learn and implement. 


I have made a FREE video training on how you too can start and scale up to earning thousands of dollars publishing books on Amazon.

The SIMPLEST Online Business Model.
Publishing Books that you don't even have to write  is the simplest online business model quote me.

I’ve tried …

Mini importation
Amazon FBA
Facebook ad agency
Consulting

But, I’d pick Publishing Documents on Amazon over all of the above every single day.

No upfront investment❌
No inventory❌
No storage❌
No packaging❌
No shipping❌
Create once, sell for years😊
Easy to manage〽️
Automatic instant delivery🎯
Fairly passive (You can automate it)🔥

Even if you are a student🔊


With your smartphone
