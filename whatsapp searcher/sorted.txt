12/19/21, 6:29 PM - +234 818 216 9911: *🔊 AD*
*Hi, my name is Ayomide Olatunde*
I am a law student of the University of Ibadan.
Earlier this year, I was seriously in need of a business that could generate me an income aleven as a student, hearing about the devastating unemployment rate in Nigeria.
 *Why was this?* 
One day a question struck my mind and here was the question,
 _"what if after studying this course, I join the thousands of unemployed undergraduates getting frustrated looking for jobs, how would I survive?"_
This question made me realise that I have to prepare for the unforseen at every moment in my life so as not to be caught unaware. 
I had watched my mum labour soo hard as an employee and I know the heartaches she went through reporting at work early in the morning and back home as late as 9pm.
 Yet, the job didn't even give her great income to make anything for herself.
 
 All she could do was settle debts, help some family members in the village, give us something to eat, send us to school and that was all. 
She couldn't even spend her hard earned money on herself! 
I knew if I didn't do something while I was still younger, I would most likely end up in that cycle.
This same question led me to surfing the Internet for a flexible business I could run alongside my law degree. 
The search went on for almost 2 weeks until I stumbled on a *1 day training that introduced a legitimate business that I could run online.* 
I immediately went through the video training to see what was there after which I was convinced that it was a business I could run alongside my law degree as there were notable people from diverse profession such as lawyers, doctors, nurses, professors, students and even the unemployed, this business could even pay much more than most salary jobs in Nigeria. 
6 months later, that business I was introduced to in that 1 day training has made me over 1 million naira. 
Well you might think I'm bluffing, but how about I show you whether I am or not in my one day intensive training. 
This November alone, I have done over 300k and the month is not over yet, meaning there is still much money to be made.
 *Here is why I am telling you this.* 
I know some people have dreams but they are limited because of funds to chase their dreams and desires, thousands of graduates are unemployed and even those in a 9-5 are living in debt due to low salary and the height of inflation is alarming. 
 So I have decided to train as many Nigerians that desire financial breakthrough.
You might want to lie to yourself that this isn't for you but if you earn 300k and below monthly, then this is for you. 
 ```Affiliate Marketing has changed my life and I decided to change people's life like the way my friend did.```
